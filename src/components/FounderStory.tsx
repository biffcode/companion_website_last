                    "We were tired of AI that could only talk about doing things, but couldn't actually do them. 
                    While everyone was copying and pasting from LLMs, we wanted to create an AI that could operate computers 
                    directly—a true AI companion that works <em>for</em> you, not just <em>with</em> you.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p className="text-lg">
                    We built Companion to be the bridge between AI's potential and real-world action. 
                    It's not just another chatbot—it's a prosthetic that allows AI to reach into your digital 
                    world and actually accomplish tasks while you focus on what matters.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p className="text-lg">
                    Our mission is simple: give people back their time by creating an AI that doesn't just 
                    suggest solutions but implements them. While you're enjoying life, Companion is handling the 
                    digital busywork that used to consume your day."
