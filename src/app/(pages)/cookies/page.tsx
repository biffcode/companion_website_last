            This Cookie Policy ("Policy") explains how AIOS Companion SA and its affiliates ("we", "our", "us", "AIOS Companion") use cookies and similar tracking technologies on our websites, applications, and online services (collectively, the "Services").

          <p className="text-secondary-400 mb-6">
            Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer, smartphone, tablet, or other device when you visit a website. They allow the website to recognize your device and remember if you have been to the website before. Cookies are a common technology used by virtually all websites.
          </p>
          <p className="text-secondary-400 mb-6">
            In addition to cookies, we may use other similar technologies, such as web beacons (also known as pixels or clear gifs), local storage, and mobile device identifiers. For simplicity, we refer to all of these technologies as "cookies" throughout this Policy.
          </p>

          <p className="text-secondary-400 mb-6">
            Some cookies are placed by third parties on our behalf. Third parties may receive information about your use of our Services through cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies. These third parties may include business partners, advertising networks, social media platforms, and analytics providers.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-secondary-500 mt-8 mb-4">5. Cookie Management</h2>
          <p className="text-secondary-400 mb-4">
            Most web browsers allow you to manage your cookie preferences. You can:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-secondary-400 space-y-2">
            <li>Delete cookies from your device</li>
            <li>Block cookies by activating the setting on your browser that allows you to refuse all or some cookies</li>
            <li>Set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-secondary-400 mb-6">
            Please note that if you choose to block or delete cookies, you may not be able to access certain areas or features of our Services, and some functionalities may be unavailable to you.
          </p>
          
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-secondary-500 mt-8 mb-4">6. Do Not Track Signals</h2>
          <p className="text-secondary-400 mb-6">
            Some browsers have a "Do Not Track" feature that signals to websites that you visit that you do not want to have your online activity tracked. Given the disparate ways in which browsers implement and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they are even aware of them. Therefore, we currently do not respond to Do Not Track signals.
          </p>
          
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-secondary-500 mt-8 mb-4">7. Data Retention</h2>
          <p className="text-secondary-400 mb-6">
            The information stored in cookies is kept for a period appropriate to the purpose for which it was collected. Cookies set by us will remain on your device until you delete them or they expire based on the timeframe set in each cookie.
          </p>
          
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-secondary-500 mt-8 mb-4">8. Changes to This Cookie Policy</h2>
